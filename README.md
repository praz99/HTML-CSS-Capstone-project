# HTML & CSS Capstone-project
This repository is created for the HTML & CSS capstone project as a part of Microverse Inc. curriculum. This project is based on an online directory of schools> But the project has been personalised and instead of directory of schools I have made a online directory of books. The [original design](https://www.behance.net/gallery/25563385/PatashuleKE) can be seen here.
